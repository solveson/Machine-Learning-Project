# Machine-Learning-Project

This repo contains my submission for the Coursera Machine Learning Project.

It contains several files:
 * An RMD file with R code segments from my work for this project and my write-up.
 * An HTML file that resulted from knitting the RMD file.
 * An HTML index that is supposed to point to github.io, but doesn't work.

**I recommend** that you view the RMD file online by clicking on the RMD link above for best clarity.
